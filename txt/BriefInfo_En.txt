ðŸ“Œ I'm studying **Software Engineering** at the *University of Information Technology*. After my graduation, I'll be looking for a job as a **back-end junior developer**. I love *Mathematics*, *Natural Science* and *Computer Science*. Besides my school projects, I also work on some personal projects and research about Data structures and Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Code Architectures, Design Patterns, Calculus, Group Theory, Fast Fourier Transformation,... I've created some joke coding projects just for fun and testing my knowledge as well (you can visit my <a href="https://github.com/CuteTN?tab=repositories">repositories</a> to play around with them sometimes!)
